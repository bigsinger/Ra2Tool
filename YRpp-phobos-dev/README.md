This project is intended to provide an ability to interact with the Yuri's Revenge engine from the C++ engine patches/extensions. This mainly targets Phobos but is also suitable for other engine extensions.

To see how to submit improvements to YRpp please visit [the corresponding docs section of Phobos](https://phobos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Contributing.html#working-with-yrpp-via-submodules).
